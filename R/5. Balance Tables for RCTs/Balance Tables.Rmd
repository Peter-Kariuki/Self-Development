A balance table helps you check how covariates/potential controls looks like across the treatments. If there is a significant difference (Imbalance) then you need to control for those covariates when checking treatments causal effects.
```{r}

data2 <-data.frame(x1 = rnorm(n = 100, mean = 100, sd = 15), 
                  x2=rnorm(n = 100, mean = 65), 
                  treatment = sample(c("Control","Treatment"),100,replace = T),
                  gender=sample(c("Male", "Female"),100,replace = T),
                  education=sample(c("Primary","Secondary","Tertialy"),100,replace = T),
                  gender_imb=rep(c("Male","Female"),times=c(80,20)))


library(vtable)
data2 %>% 
  sumtable(group = "treatment",group.test = T)








```
